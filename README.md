Matching Game
=====================

## This is a project assigned for Project 2 of the Front End Nanodegree--to create a matching game using html, css, and javascript. 

Game Rules
----------

The matching game consists of sixteen cards, which contain a certain number of dots on their front faces.  There are eight pairs of cards in the deck that have the same face.  The cards are arranged randomly at the beginning of game play.  To win or complete the game, a player needs to find all the matching cards.  

Game Mechanics:

1. The player flips a card by clicking on it.
2. The player then flips another card by clicking on it.  
3. If the cards match, the cards stay face up.  If they don't, they are flipped back over.
4. The game is won after the player successfully matches all the cards.
